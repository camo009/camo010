  <h4>Short story about bureaucracy.</h4>
    <p>This work was made in response to a proposal that asked us to create a fictional world that expands upon present-day issues. First, we were to research other media, then to propose our own ideas and then finally to present our finished works. In the researching phase, I initially concentrated on some elements of the grimdark fantasy world Warhammer 40,000 as my main source of inspiration, with emphasis on the inefficient and sclerotic government of the Imperium of Man. From there I was introduced to other media that depicted bureaucracy such as the film ‘Brazil’ by Terry Gilliam and the novel ‘The Castle’ by Franz Kafka and sought to incorporate elements of those works in my own.</p>
    <p>My first proposal was to create a 3d interactive environment, but I felt it would be difficult to depict all the themes and ideas I wished to incorporate into the works, so it was at this stage I switched to that of a short story or first chapter of a book.</p>
    <p>I wanted to create a main character working for a government agency who would face challenges throughout the day that were either unsolvable or made difficult by any help offered being useless. I wanted superiors to be generally incompetent, with a lack of knowledge and priorities utterly misplaced. On top of this a culture of avoiding criticism or acceptance of responsibility would be present, with everything passed down to the lowest level workers. Communication would be slow or non-existent, with work being contracted out to external organisations exacerbating this.</p>
    <p>The main character would have an awareness of the way their absurd world works, with an acceptance that there isn’t much they can do to change it, and to spend their day attempting to navigate it and tackle their Sisyphean tasks.</p>

    <p>The trains didn’t fit. The reason 7 stood in the pounding rain. Shifting weight to his other leg, 7 felt his sock, momentarily acting as a sponge, happily release its content into his shoe.  How could they not fit? Fifteen years and billions spent, and no one had thought to measure the height of the trains. A brand-new gleaming station was located 100 metres below. Warm and dry in cascading white, surrounded by all the desired amenities but mainly, to 7’s annoyance, completely empty. Instead, he stood exposed to the elements, on the old platform that was at least twice the age of anyone on it, lamenting that he had allowed his umbrella subscription to run out. Anticipation of the opening of the new station had only further compounded the disrepair of the old one. It was evident to most onlookers that any sort of upkeep had been discontinued. Indeed, it had been half dismantled by the time someone decided to bring out a tape measure and left in that sorry state while the blame was handed round.</p>
    <p>As 7 sulked, his graffiti bombed train arrived, its doors making a valiant first effort at opening but quickly changing their mind, acting as if they had always intended to only stop halfway. When 7 departed four stops later, the weather had abated no more than his mood. His journey across town wasn’t planned, he’d have gone straight to the Department of Transportation first thing if it was, but the news had only trickled through that morning.</p>
    <p>The Department of Transportation headquarters stood on the corner of two thoroughfares, a low rise that had been subjected to repeated renovations, its slick glass exterior doing its utmost to hide the palimpsest of its art deco origin. Stone steps led up to a large revolving glass door, beyond which lay a marble foyer crisscrossed with rope bollards, funnelling queues of people to information desks. 7 squelched past these and went straight to the lift, handing his department issued meeting ticket to the guard along the way. The third floor greeted 7 with a large carpeted open workspace, cubicles crammed between pillars, an office at the far end. The contrasting effect of arriving on this level from the ground floor gave visitors a certain stylistic whiplash, an experience, 7 suspected, was the express aim of whichever architect had been handed the reigns of this renovation. An assortment of eyes gazed at 7 as he made his way to the office, momentarily distracted by their damp guest, some hushed murmurs, a recirculated mixture of sweat and perfume hung in the air.</p>
    <p>7 knocked on the half glass door, a grunt from within signalled that he could enter. If not for the sign on the door reading Mr Johnson, 7 could have mistaken the office for a storage cupboard, for much of the room was dedicated to filing cabinets, sometimes multiple rows deep. Files and documents overflowed from these, leaving the large mahogany desk in the middle of the room looking much like an island afloat in a sea of paper. An oil painting that depicted an offshore oil rig hung on the wall. At the desk sat a squat man, the fluorescent lighting doing no favours to the flushed face and bald head that looked as if it had just popped out of his suit.</p>
    <p>“Are you 7?” blurted the man. 7 nodded. “Been told you’re the only one who knows the layout of district H.” 7 didn’t have the faintest clue about district H, but hoping to avoid answering replied, “Mrs Conrad tells me you needed some help; however, I’ve not been told anything beyond there’s flooding.” “It’s not a flood!” the dyspeptic man snapped. “Whoever told you that must be mistaken.” “You’re correct, I misspoke,” 7 replied quickly. “Mrs Conrad told me there was only a leak.” Mr Johnson considered this for a moment and then continued, “Yes, well, usually we’d have this all under control of course, it just so happens our usual expert is away on other business, so I’m a little light on staff.” As if to emphasis this point, he motioned with his hand toward the workers outside his door. “On a routine check of the Tranquillity Now Station my engineers discovered a small leak, and in the interest of safety an evacuation was ordered, and my engineers expertly managed to avoid a potential crisis.” As he paused, 7 got the feeling he was expected to congratulate this accomplishment. “And so,” Mr Johnson went on, “We need you to get down there as quickly as possible and sort this mess out, it’s not an emergency, but your superiors would be very appreciative if you could square all of this away.” As Mr Johnson said this, he began rummaging in one of the filing cabinets behind him, eventually pulling out several sheets of paper. “But first, before I send you on your way, there are just a few forms that need to be filled out, won’t take a second.” He slid the documents across the table and handed 7 a pen.</p>
    <p>Despite the apparent time pressure of the situation, 7 spent the next ten minutes filling out the paperwork. He entered the time and date, confirmed that Mr Johnson and himself had conducted a meeting in the former’s office, completed his role and employment details and signed the non-disclosure agreement. The next few sheets of paper contained a questionnaire. 7 gave feedback on such things as the quality of the signage in the headquarters, the availability of tea or coffee, if the ambient temperature was of an acceptable level, and if he would recommend a visit to friends and family. When he was done, he handed the paperwork across to Mr Johnson who slid them into an unmarked manilla folder, and promptly placed them in a different filing cabinet. “Right,” said Mr Johnson, satisfied, “I’ll let you get going. Here are your written orders.” He handed 7 an envelope. “And don’t forget that as well,” pointing at something on the ground behind 7. 7’s eyes followed his direction, saw a steel bucket beside the doorframe and gave what he thought was the appropriate chuckle needed when a superior tries their hand at humour. The laugh was not reciprocated, instead what greeted 7 when he turned back around was a blank stare from Mr Johnson. “Oh, uh, thank you Mr Johnson,” mollified 7, “That is exactly what I’ll need.” “Do you not like the bucket? The super intendent told me only this morning that this is an excellent bucket.” “No, you’re quite right, that is an excellent bucket, I will take it with me at once. Thank you, Mr Johnson.” And with that 7 departed the office, bucket in tow.</p>
    <p>The downpour had if anything increased while 7 had been inside. The rain pinged off his bucket as he hurried to the nearest underground and boarded the train to Tranquillity Now Station, lost in his thoughts as he attempted to recall which water authority he would need to contact when he arrived. He stood clutching a rail, vaguely aware that other passengers kept moving about, as if eternally dissatisfied with their seats. It was only after he noticed his leg was tiring from leaning forward as he had been, in anticipation of the carriage lurching forward, that he realised that this movement would not be forthcoming. The train wasn’t leaving the station. The agitated passengers, he now realised, had been those that had boarded and then left after they became aware that the line was now terminated. Chastising himself for taking so long to realise what was happening, after all he was perhaps the only passenger who knew a station down the line was flooding, 7 left in search of a taxi.</p>
    <p>7 arrived at the street outside Tranquillity Now Station at midday. After signing his cheque for the driver, 7 stepped out onto the stone pavement. The high street of district H on which he now stood was bustling with people, hurrying quickly between marquees, the rain forcing lunch goers to abandon the chairs beneath parasols in favour of the tables indoors. Above the entrance to the station were written the words ‘Lockheed Martin Tranquillity Now Station’. The entrance to which was shared with that of a shopping centre, where a set of stairs behind turnstiles lead down to the platform. At the top of the stairs, beside a large sign that said, ‘OUT OF ORDER’, stood two men wearing hardhats, deep in conversation.</p>
    <p>As 7 approached they paid him no attention, but after he stood beside them, they turned and informed 7 the station was closed. “So I see,” replied 7. “Are you two from the Department of Transport?” “No,” asserted the larger of the two men. “Then are you here about the flooding?” probed 7. “There’s no flooding, it’s only a leak.” The slight pause that followed allowed the sound of gushing water to fill the entrance space. So as not to draw too much attention to this, 7 asked from which department they were from instead. “We’re not from any, we’re with WeFixQuik,” sighed the smaller of the two, looking down at his clipboard as he said it. 7 knew WeFixQuik was a favourite of government departments when an outsourced casual workforce was needed. The man looked up from his clipboard, “Is there something we can help you with? Otherwise, I’m going to have to ask you to leave the immediate area.” “I’m from the Department of Transportation,” replied 7. “Okay, and what am I supposed to do with that bit of information?” “Well, I’m here about the flood.” “As my colleague has already informed you, there is no flood.” “Then I’m here about the leak, I’ve been sent to assist.” “Have you got any written orders?” 7 placed the steel bucket on the ground and produced from his pocket the envelope Mr Johnston had given him and unfolded the letter within. Only now, looking at it for the first time, did 7 see what was written on it. </p>
    <p>Where 7 was expecting to see an authorisation of work in the prevention of water damage addressed to his name, he instead saw an 11-month subscription renewal of an oil painting titled ‘Drilling at Sunset: by ExxonMobil’. “I’ve brought the wrong orders, but you can at least see from the envelope that I am from the Department of Transportation.” He handed the man with the clipboard the letter, who, after blinking at it for a moment, replied. “This is about a subscription.” “Yes, that is the mistake,” 7 said quickly, “But you can see the envelope is from the Department of Transportation, so you’ll understand that is where I am from, and why I’ve been sent.” “Why would they send you to us about a subscription?” “I’ve not been sent to renew a subscription, I’ve been sent to assist in the floo- I mean leak.” “That’s not what that letter says.” “Yes, I know that is not what the letter says, that’s what I’m trying to make clear to you,” 7 pleaded, exasperated. 7 could see it wasn’t sinking in, the man with the clipboard was losing interest. “Sorry, but we aren’t working for anyone that deals with subscriptions,” he handed back the letter. “You’ll have to take it to someone that does. Now as I said before, this station is closed, so can you please leave.”</p>
    <p>The phonebooth 7 found himself in resembled something close to a shrine, dozens of names had been carved into the Perspex glass, providing 7 with some dry reading material as he listened to the equally dull classical music through the handset. He had been on hold with department headquarters for fifteen minutes when he finally got through. “I’m looking to speak to the Head of Department, a Mr Johnson?” “Just a moment sir,” came back a voice. After another minute it returned, “Sorry sir, Mr Johnson isn’t available at this time.” “When is he available?” “He’s booked up all today and for the next three weeks, can I take a message?” “No. But thank you all the same.” He hung up. 7 stood and thought, the booth rattling as the wind and rain lashed at it, the gaps in its construction teasing the elements, daring them to pick the phone booth up and carry both him and it away. He hadn’t much choice, he would have to return to the department headquarters, bucket in hand, and attempt to explain how he had ended up with the wrong written orders.</p>
    <p>Outside the headquarters 7 burst from the taxi, gasping to slake his desire for fresh air. The taxi had been pleasantly warm, but even the copious amount of cleaning agents wasn’t enough to cover up the odour of whatever had left the large stain across the back seats. He passed the cheque through the driver window and hurried towards the front entrance. </p>
    <p>7 took the stairs up to the third floor. It wasn’t because he felt he needed the exercise, only that he’d been unable to take the lift. It didn’t appear to be broken, rather it just seemingly had no interest in reaching the ground floor, as if it had developed a grudge and began perpetually servicing every floor bar it out of spite. So, after several minutes of waiting 7 had found the stairs and upon reaching the third floor found himself at something of a dead end. Everything about the stairwell was normal, a fire extinguisher hung on the wall, a stray mop gathered dust in the corner and a sign informed him he was on the correct floor. The only issue is that there seemed to be no door. The staircase went no further as well, despite there being at least another few storeys above. Ignoring this 7 went down to the second floor, which thankfully did have a door, and wound his way to the temperamental lift once more.</p>
    <p>Whereas before the third floor had been a quiet affair, it now seemed anything but. The previously near silent workers were now up out of their chairs, rushing around in all different directions. Some seemed to be searching for something, sifting through drawers and paperwork, while others were just moving about, trying not to look like they weren’t busy. 7 heard shouting from the opposite end, where a harried looking assistant had just darted from Mr Johnson’s office, fresh from a recent spray of his invective. 7 stopped a nearby worker and asked what was going on. “A letter is missing from his office; a renewal order that must be sent today. We’ve spent half the day searching for it,” they informed him, before hurrying off again.</p>
    <p>7 made his way to Mr Johnson’s office and knocked on the door. “AS I’VE ALREADY MADE CLEAR TO YOU, UNLESS YOU’VE GOT THAT LETTER I DON’T CARE WHA-,“ Mr Johnson stopped at the sight of 7 as he entered. “Oh, it’s you, that was quick. Did you finish up at district H?” “Not as of yet, I’ve come back to get my written orders, I forgot to ask for them before,” replied 7. “Ah yes, so you did, it’s been sitting in my drawer all morning.” As Mr Johnson began searching his desk drawer, 7 quickly ducked down into a crouch position as if to pick something up off the ground, pulling the subscription renewal letter for the oil painting out of his pocket as he did so. When he re-emerged from beneath the desk, he did his best to feign a look of casual disinterest at his discovery. “This was beneath your desk by the way,” handing the letter across to Mr Johnson. Mr Johnson’s eyes bulged, and he looked as if he was about to burst before managing to compose himself and saying, “Ah, there it is, that bastard of a letter has been evading me all morning. Needed it sent off today at the latest.” He opened the letter containing the subscription renewal and frowned. “Someone’s written in the wrong address, this is no use, I’ll need another form,” scrunching up the letter before tossing it into a wastepaper bin. Mr Johnson bellowed for his assistant and 7 took his leave, new written orders in hand.</p>
